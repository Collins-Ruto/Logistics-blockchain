                The WHO evidence retrieval sub-group has begun collaboration with key partners to enrich the citations and build a more comprehensive database with inclusion of other content. The database is built by BIREME, the Specialized Center of PAHO/AMRO and part of the Regional Office’s Department of Evidence and Intelligence for Action in Health.

            <h1>DISTRIBUTION</h1>
            <p>

                    KEMSA delivers medical supplies to the door step of each health facility in Kenya consistently and efficiently. KEMSA, in partnership with experienced third party carriers, has set up a robust distribution network with the capacity to reach all Public Hospitals, Health Centers and Dispensaries countrywide.
                    KEMSA also distributes program commodities which at times are integrated with EMMS. This includes reproductive health commodities, nutritional food supplements, TB/Leprosy and ARV’s. This is aimed at reducing distribution costs and managing medical commodities within one supply chain resulting in greater reach and efficiencies.
                    Orders are made through the KEMSA LMIS, Program Memos and Distribution Lists. These are planned into optimal routes and shared with relevant departments for capturing in Warehouse Management System (WMS) for keying in and picking before finally shipping to Health facilities. Load planning is thereafter arranged for various carriers depending on the region covered.
                    Transport status is confirmed with the carrier and Expected Time of Arrival (ETA) ascertained, thereafter, Customer Service representatives communicate shipment status and delivery expectations to the facilities.
                <h5>SHIPMENT MONITORING</h5>                
                    KEMSA monitors transport, shipment location, movement, and progress towards delivering medical commodities to destined facilities.
                    Vehicles on transit are monitored using phone calls, GPRS software and monitoring PC and display screens at the shipment tracking centre in Embakasi. This guarantees security of shipment and aids in lead time management.
                    Monitoring of trucks is also done through keeping in touch with transporters, calling and sending mails to ensure they send daily tracking tools showing the number of facilities delivered per day.
                <h5>SECURITY</h5>
                    Security coordination (public and private) and potential weather delays are also managed, monitored, and taken into consideration. The process is done for both internal and third party trucks.
                
                <h5>ORDER VERIFICATION</h5>
                    Upon Arrival at the Health facility, the officers will open and verify all the boxes in the presence of those in charge of transport to confirm condition and number of cartons against provided delivery documentation.
                    The logistics remain versatile and responsive to customer requirements. KEMSA makes timely deliveries against hospital orders with regular deliveries to rural health facilities based on a mutually agreed schedule.
                    Confirmation of Proof of Delivery (POD) against a given distribution list is finally done to ensure all POD’s are stamped with details of receiving officers captured clearly. POD facility details is captured to the Warehouse Management System (WMS) and updated immediately.
                    The PODs are then scanned and handed over to sales and marketing team for invoicing. Distribution department maintains a copy for records per counties and sub counties respectively.
